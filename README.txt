Here are images and videos (and sound?) used in built in Talkyard tutorials and wizards and stuff. (Talkyard: https://github.com/debiki/talkyard)

Could move all icon fonts, and PNG arrows, to here, too? I.e. `modules/fontello` and `public/res/img`.

All this stuff is in its own repository, so if it grows large because people add too many videos and stuff, and there're old videos no longer in use in the Git history — then this repo can be squashed, and made small again. Without affecting the main repo with all source code (it just needs to be updated to link to the new history-squashed version of this repo).


The favicon/* icons were generated by https://realfavicongenerator.net
(which I found via: https://stackoverflow.com/a/19590415).
I created an icon in Inkscape, uploaded, configured settings, and then downloaded
a favicon_package_v0.16.zip that I extracted to `./favicon/`, and followed
these intructions, by editing the Nginx config — however, I placed
the files in sub dir /-/media/favicon/ instead: (for simpler Nginx config)

```
Insert the following code in the <head> section of your pages:
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/favicon-32x32.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/favicon-16x16.png">
<link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest">
<link rel="mask-icon" href="/safari-pinned-tab.svg" color="#0060ad">
<meta name="msapplication-TileColor" content="#b91d47">
<meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff">
```
